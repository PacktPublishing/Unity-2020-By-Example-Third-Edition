# Changelog
These are the release notes for the TextMesh Pro UPM package which was first introduced with Unity 2018.1. Please see the following link for the Release Notes for prior versions of TextMesh Pro. http://digitalnativestudios.com/forum/index.php?topic=1363.0

## [3.0.0] - 2019-10-30
### Changes
- Updated TMP Examples & Extras to remove CanvasRenderer from text objects in example scenes.
- CanvasRenderer component will now be removed from existing text objects that contains this unnecessary component.
- Editing a prefab that contains a normal <TextMeshPro> component will no longer open the prefab in Canvas mode. Case #1103782 and Case #1188483

## [2.1.0-preview.2] - 2019-10-30
## [1.5.0-preview.2]
### Changes
- Fixed Input Field issue when Read Only flag is set preventing the initial setting of the text. Also fixed Read Only flag not being respected when using IME input.
- Fixed potential infinite loop when using text overflow mode ScrollRect. See Case #1188867
- Fixed Input Field culling related issue(s) where text would be incorrectly culled. See https://forum.unity.com/threads/version-1-5-0-2-1-0-preview-1-now-available-for-testing.753587/#post-5023700 
- Revised handling and referencing of the CanvasRenderer in anticipation of an incoming change to the MaskableGraphic class where it will no longer automatically add a CanvasRenderer to components inheriting from it. As a result, <TextMeshPro> objects will no longer have a CanvasRenderer.
- Fixed potential NRE when using Overflow Truncate mode with sprites. See https://forum.unity.com/threads/tmpro-stackoverflow-caused-by-tmpro-textmeshprougui-generatetextmesh.750398/page-2#post-5042822
- Fixed issue when using font weights in combination of font styles in the editor.
- Fixed for potential incorrect preferred height.
- Improved handling of StyleSheet options to reorder, add or delete styles.
- Fixed Input Field Caret & Selection Highlight potential culling issue when the object was instantiated outside the culling region.
- Fixed potential issue with registration of text objects in the TMP_UpdateManager.
- Optimization to suppress callback to InternalUpdate when parent Canvas is disabled. Case #1189820
- Fixed Fallback material not getting updated correctly when changing Generation Settings on the Fallback Font Asset.
- Fixed a typo in the Font Weight section of the Font Asset Editor.
- Fixed potential ArgumentOutOfRangeException in the Input Field when using Hide Mobile Input and deleting a long string. Case #1162514
- Added "Is Scale Static" option in the Extra Settings to exclude text objects from InternalUpdate callbacks to improve performance when the object's scale is static. This InternalUpdate callback is used to track potential changes to the scale of text objects to update their SDF Scale. 
- Added the ability to control culling modes for the TMP Shaders. This new option is available in the Debug section of the Material Inspector. New feature requires updating the TMP Essential Resources. See the following post https://forum.unity.com/threads/not-see-textmeshpro-rendering-from-the-back.767510/#post-5112461.
- Fixed Material Inspector issue when toggling the Record button in the Animation window. Case #1174960

- Added support for &ltNBSP&gt tag which is internally replaced by a non-breaking space or \u00A0.
- Improved performance when retrieving glyph adjustment records when using dynamic font assets.
- Fixed potential Null Reference Exception in the Editor when assigning new font asset to disabled game object when no previous font asset was assigned.

- Revised Character, Word, Line and Paragraph spacing adjustments to be in font units (em) where a value of 1 represents 1/100 em.
- Added TMP_Text.onFontAssetRequest and TMP_Text.onSpriteAssetRequest events to allow users to implement custom asset loading when using the &ltfont="Font Asset Name"&gt and &ltsprite="Sprite Asset Name"&gt tags.
- Additional Shader Channels on the Canvas will be set to TexCoord1, Normal and Tangents or Mixed when using TMP Surface Shaders. Otherwise it will be set to TexCoord1 only. Case #1100696
- Added new attribute to the &ltmark&gt tag to allow users to define a padding value for the mark / highlight region. Example: &ltmark color=#FFFF0080 padding="1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0"&gt where padding="Left, Right, Top, Bottom".

- Added Update Sprite Asset option in the header of the Sprite Asset inspector. This increases the discoverability of this option already available via the Sprite Asset Context Menu.
- Revised the text auto-sizing handling in regards to maximum iteration threshold which could result in a crash on some Android devices. Case #1141328

- Added new angle=x attribute to the &lti&gt tag where the value of x define the italic slant angle.
- Since the legacy TextContainer used by TMP has been deprecated, it was removed from the Layout Context Menu options.
